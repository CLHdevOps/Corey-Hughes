Example:
bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -sT 192.168.1.0/24
5. Network Exploitation
Tools:
Metasploit Framework: A powerful platform for discovering, exploiting, and managing vulnerabilities in networked systems.

Example (starting Metasploit):
bash
Copy code
sudo msfconsole
Responder: LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner to capture credentials on a network.

Example:
bash
Copy code
sudo responder -I wlan0
Bettercap: A versatile tool for network attacks, sniffing, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Example:
bash
Copy code
sudo bettercap -iface wlan0
Evil Twin Attack: Using airgeddon to create a fake Wi-Fi access point to capture credentials from unsuspecting users.

Start airgeddon:
bash
Copy code
sudo airgeddon
6. Password Cracking
Tools:
John the Ripper: A fast password cracker that supports multiple hash types.

Example (basic):
bash
Copy code
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashfile
Hydra: A brute-force tool for network logins that supports various protocols like SSH, HTTP, FTP, and more.

Example:
bash
Copy code
sudo hydra -l user -P password-list.txt ssh://192.168.1.10
Hashcat: An advanced password recovery tool for cracking hashes using your CPU or GPU.

Example (cracking a WPA handshake):
bash
Copy code
hashcat -m 2500 -a 3 capturefile.hccapx
7. Wireless Jamming
Tools:
MDK3: A Wi-Fi testing tool that allows you to flood or jam a Wi-Fi network.

Example:
bash
Copy code
sudo mdk3 wlan0mon d -c 6
